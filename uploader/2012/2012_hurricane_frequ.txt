                      2012 Hurricane Frequencies
                         By Hugh Stegman NV6H

             They only propagate errors across the Internet,
                      then I catch hell for it.


This hurricane season will determine the fate of this list.  If
HF is as dead as Irene was, the list is toast. 

After Isaac, we're still waiting, but it does not look good.

It should be obvious that "hurricane frequency" does not mean what
it did in 1990. Except for the weather schedules and two or three
amateur nets, there are no longer HF users who are guararanteed to
do something every time there's a storm.

Amateur nets move around. Just tune the band for anyone obviously
using procedures.  20 meters above 14100 is prime hunting territory
in day time, for long-distance nets. Local LSB nets use 75 or 40
meters and are audible longer distances at night. A few nets might
move to 21 MHz in the local afternoon hours, conditions permitting.

All days and times are UTC.
