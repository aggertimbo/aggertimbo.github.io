Hello.
I am very grateful to you for your council, but I can't pay additional money - I have no this sum. It's not my first purchase. If the seller provided me a Tracking number, all purchases reached me without problems. the sum of standard delivery is already included in the sum of my order and you must guarantee me delivery of my purchase. I ask you to insure a parcel at the expense of sum already paid by me. If you can't guarantee me delivery of my order, I'd like to request a refund through PayPal.

Good morning. I ask you to help me with a refund for the order 124354 or order sending. The order was paid 7 days ago.

The price to order included standard sending by air mail.

After receiving payment the seller asked to pay in addition 19 dollars of an insurance - it was not mentioned in delivery terms on a website. I sent 2 letters with a request to send the order and tracking number – the seller didn't answer.

I think the seller won't send me the order – I ask you to cancel transaction No.  and to return me money.
