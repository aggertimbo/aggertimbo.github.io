This script will install Gnu Radio from current GIT sources
You will require Internet access from the computer on which this
script runs. You will also require SUDO access. You will require
approximately 500MB of free disk space to perform the build.
 
This script will, as a side-effect, remove any existing Gnu Radio
installation that was installed from your Linux distribution packages.
It must do this to prevent problems due to interference between
a linux-distribution-installed Gnu Radio/UHD and one installed from GIT source.
 
The whole process may take up to two hours to complete, depending on the
capabilities of your system.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
NOTE: if you run into problems while running this script, you can re-run it with
the --verbose option to produce lots of diagnostic output to help debug problems.
This script has been written to anticipate some of the more common problems one might
encounter building ANY large, complex software package. But it is not pefect, and
there are certainly some situations it could encounter that it cannot deal with
gracefully. Altering the system configuration from something reasonably standard,
removing parts of the filesystem, moving system libraries around arbitrarily, etc,
it likely cannot cope with. It is just a script. It isn't intuitive or artificially
intelligent. It tries to make life a little easier for you, but at the end of the day
if it runs into trouble, a certain amount of knowledge on your part about
system configuration and idiosyncrasies will inevitably be necessary.

Failed to find just-installed command 'guile' after pre-requisite installation.
This very likely indicates that the pre-requisite installation failed
to install one or more critical pre-requisites for Gnu Radio/UHD
